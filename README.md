## About
A social media-inspired platform for students to discuss topics learn in classes. Although the main audience of the website is targeted to be CS major, students are free to create their own forums/threads for different topics/subjects. 

## Status
The website is under development. Will update as soon as it goes online.

## Tech Stack
The project is built using MERN web development stack.
* [`MongoDB`](https://www.mongodb.com): A general purpose, document-based, distributed NoSQL database
* [`Express`](https://expressjs.com): Lightweight and fast web framework built on top of Node.js
* [`React`](https://reactjs.org): A javascript library developed by Facebook to build user interface
* [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/): Javascript runtime

The website also incorporates modern frameworks/libraries/tools to make development more reliably and securely. Some examples include:
* [`jsonwebtoken`](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken): for secure user authorization
* [`mocha`](https://mochajs.org), [`supertest`](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest), [`chai`](https://www.chaijs.com): for automated integration testing
* [`travis_ci`](https://travis-ci.com): for continuous integration, both for testing and deployment
* [`nyc`](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc) and [`coveralls`](https://coveralls.io): test coverage
